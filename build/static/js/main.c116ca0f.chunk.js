Afterwards I got my team together and let them know I would have liked to see more effort put in. I listened to what my teammates had to say. They understood my disappointment, agreed they could have done more, and said they'd catch up and stick to the timeline. Since I was the only one who organized our project I asked them if they wanted to make any changes, because I expected I may have given too little time for hard features and too much time for easy features. They both said it was still good and so we left the meeting with the plan unchanged.",Object(ve.jsx)("br",{}),Object(ve.jsx)("br",{}),"At the end of week 7 our project partner asked about when a demo would become available. This caused me to request we all merged our project, and gave a realistic evaluation of where we're at. Both members completed what was required earlier, but still didn't match the styling with what we had designed. So now was time to pivot. I narrowed down what was core to our application and asked my team if we could get there. After finding an agreement, I created a new, short-term timeline to plan what each of us was to do to get a demo working by week 10."]})]})})]})}}]),n}(re.a.Component),nn=function(e){Object(je.a)(n,e);var t=Object(pe.a)(n);function n(){return Object(he.a)(this,n),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(be.a)(n,[{key:"componentDidMount",value:function(){window.scrollTo(0,0)}},{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(ve.jsxs)(re.a.Fragment,{children:[Object(ve.jsx)("span",{id:"top"}),Object(ve.jsxs)(At,{children:[Object(ve.jsx)(Ct,{children:"Overseer"}),Object(ve.jsx)(Mt,{children:"Physics puzzles with horror..."})]}),Object(ve.jsx)(St,{children:Object(ve.jsxs)(zt,{children:[Object(ve.jsx)(Wt,{children:"What I Learned"}),Object(ve.jsx)(Ht,{children:"AI Behaiviors - Playtesting"}),Object(ve.jsx)(Dt,{children:"After following a lot of tutorials for using Unity, I finally felt confident to work on my own project.

From this decision, the game came together for me. I made pieces that move like a knight, bishop and rook. (Queen movement was overpowered) Each piece had abilities that gave them purpose. By having more pieces the player has more options to attack without moving, but they have to balance what pieces they want to move out of the way of damage.
